    <p class="textData"> A <b>freelancer</b>  is self-employed person offering services, usually to businesses and often to multiple clients at a time. The type of work freelancers do varies. Nearly every type of service could be provided by a freelancer, including (but not
        limited to), marketing, such as social media marketing, copywriting, and publicity, writing, such as articles and blog posts, technological support, such as web programming and design, creative works such as graphic design, and financial support,
        such as bookkeeping and household works such as bringing groceries, finding maids and many more.   According to the Freelancers Union, 55 million Americans--35% of the workforce--have freelance careers, with a combined estimated earnings of $1
        trillion a year.  Freelancing is so flexible, you can set your own hours, working full or part-time on the projects of your choice. While clients can offer specifications to the work, a freelancer works similar to an independent contractor, in
        which he's free to control how the work is completed. This is an important distinction for tax purposes, because the IRS views employees and independent contractors differently. Further, freelancing allows you to set your own price, which is often
        higher than what you'd make as an employee doing the same work.  The regularity of freelance work can vary. Many freelancers work for the same set of clients over a long period of time. For example, a freelance writer might have a client that
        requires an article twice a week ongoing. Others work with clients over shorter periods, usually on specific projects. For example, a freelance web designer might build a website for a client and once the site is done, so is the work relationship</p>

    <!--<p class="textData">
        According to the 2012 Freelance Industry Report compiled primarily about North America freelancing, nearly half of freelancers do writing work, with 18% of freelancers listing writing as a primary skill, 10% editing/copy-editing, and 10% as copy-writing.
        20% of freelancers listed their primary skills as design. Next on the list was translating (8%), web development (5.5%), and marketing (4%).Elance, a web platform that connects freelancers with contractors, surveyed its members and 39% listed
        writing and editing as their main skill set. Depending on the industry, freelance work practices vary and have changed over time. In some industries such as consulting, freelancers may require clients to sign written contracts. While in journalism
        or writing, freelancers may work for free or do work "on spec" to build their reputations or a relationship with a publication. Some freelancers may provide written estimates of work and request deposits from clients. Payment for freelance work
        also depends on industry, skills, and experience. Freelancers may charge by the day, hour, a piece rate, or on a per-project basis. Instead of a flat rate or fee, some freelancers have adopted a value-based pricing method based on the perceived
        value of the results to the client. By custom, payment arrangements may be upfront, percentage upfront, or upon completion. For more complex projects, a contract may set a payment schedule based on milestones or outcomes. One of the drawbacks
        of freelancing is that there is no guaranteed payment, and the work can be highly precarious. In writing and other artistic fields, "freelance" and its derivative terms are often reserved for workers who create works on their own initiative and
        then seek a publisher. They typically retain the copyright to their works and sell the rights to publishers in time-limited contracts. Traditionally, works would be submitted to publishers, where they would become part of the slush pile, and would
        either elicit an offer to buy (an "acceptance letter") or a rejection slip. People who create intellectual property under a work for hire situation (according to the publishers' or other customers' specifications) are sometimes referred to as
        "independent contractors" or other similar terms. Creators give up their rights to their works in a "works made for hire" situation, a category of intellectual property defined in U.S. copyright law — Section 101, Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USC
        §101). The protection of the intellectual property rights that give the creator of the work are considered to have been sold into a work for hire agreement of employees, however in a contractual rather than employment relationship. People who
